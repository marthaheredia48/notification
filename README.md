## Notifications Feature 

In our final project for the NASA Space Apps Hackathon, we aimed to implement the notifications feature using SwiftUI. However, due to certain limitations and time constraints, we were unable to fully integrate this feature in SwiftUI.

Instead, we developed and successfully implemented the notifications feature using **Storyboard**, which works seamlessly. Below is the code that demonstrates how the notifications are triggered and handled using this approach.

Although we couldn’t implement it in SwiftUI as initially planned, this solution still meets the project’s requirements and ensures smooth functionality for sending notifications.
