## Notifications Feature 

In our final project for the NASA Space Apps Hackathon, we aimed to implement the notifications feature using SwiftUI. However, due to certain limitations and time constraints, we were unable to fully integrate this feature in SwiftUI.

Instead, we developed and successfully implemented the notifications feature using Storyboard, which works seamlessly. Although we couldnâ€™t implement it in SwiftUI as initially planned, this solution ensures smooth functionality for sending notifications.
